                            <p>Hi! I'm Sanjana. I have just completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from the 
                                department of Computer Science and Technology from <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/">Bangladesh 
                                    University of Engineering and Technology</a>. I'm currently working as a Research Assistant to 
                                    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mahmudanaznin/Home">Dr. Mahmuda Naznin</a> , Professor, 
                                    Ex-Dept. Head, CSE, BUET. My research interests encompasses <b>Biomedical Image Analysis</b>, <b>Human Computer Interaction</b>, <b>Vision</b> and <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>. 
                                Currently I'm looking to pursue a PhD in one of those relevant fields and hope to develop innovative solutions 
                                to actual real-life problems. </p>
                            <p>I aspire to develop projects that change the world for the better. Which is why, 
                                my undergraduate life was filled with constant participation in hackathon contests. One of my 
                                projects from these contests gained widespread attention earning a 
                                <a href="https://www.tbsnews.net/features/panorama/watcher-twenty-four-seven-app-can-protect-you-against-sexual-harassment-264916">news article</a> and

                                I have also completed an internship on full-stack web app development. From my past projects you'll see 
                                that I'm pretty comfortable with developing full-stack web and android apps, hardware projects and projects involving
                                machine learning.</p>

                    <p class="about_para_onwards">My undergraduate thesis was involved with determining the hip fracture
                        risk depending on different fall scenario. We first predicted the stress and strain distributions
                        over the bone and then used a modified <b>vision transformer</b> to predict risk category. The work's 
                        manuscript is currently in submission. My current work as a research assistant involves improving
                        the time intensiveness of the entire long pipeline by replacing it with a shorter lightweight 
                        <b>multimodal</b> pipeline. Due to my interest in security & privacy, I'm working on a personal 
                        project that involves detection of adversial malware generated by intelligent generators like

                    <p class="about_para_onwards">I love being active in my everyday life. Extra-curriculars took up a significant portion of 
                        each year of my undergraduate life. As evident through my multiple contest participations. I have also worked as a Campus 
                        Ambassador for <b>Bdapps, Robi</b> and as the head of the decoration committee of <b>BUET CSE FEST 2023</b>. I love any activity that allows
                        me to exercise my creativity.</p>
                    <p class="about_para_onwards">However my life's dreams aren't purely limited to pursuit of betterment of the world.
                         My hobbies include writing, crocheting, baking etc. My bucket list activities include visiting as many countries as 
                         I can, trying out their cuisines and amusement parks and adopting as many cats I can. Because everyone needs a cat or five

                                The study focuses on predicting the fracture risk index from the voxelized bone data. Applied machine 
                                learning techniques are used to predict the stress and strain distributions over the nodes of the bone.
                                The stress, strain and bone density values are then plotted using the rgb channels respectively to get a 
                                visual representation of the values. Different views are generated by rotating the bone. A vision transformer
                                is trained on the different views to find the best performing view angle. The vision transformer is modified to
                                find the layer architecture with highest accuracy and less computing time. This method has an
                                accuracy of almost 95% and works better than previous methods of prediction and PointNet-based classification.

                                Assistant Professor, ME, University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The current pipeline for fracture risk 
                                assessment stands as: voxelization -> csv data -> regression -> image data -> classification with vision 
                                transformer -> Fracture Risk index. However, each of these steps is very time intensive and resource hungry, 
                                impractical for everyday medical use. Also we left out patients physiological features like - age, race, sex etc.
                                We plan to use multimodal architecture to shorten this pipeline and integrate those features. 
                                We will also employ some PEFT techniques to bring the computational time and resources down to 
                                practical levels. The new pipeline will have 3 stages. Stage 1 and 2 can be run parallely and thus save time.
                                Stage 1: bone qct slices -> grayscale value arrays -> pixel positional encoding -> image encoding -> vision 
                                transformer based encoding -> adapter -> image embedding. Stage 2: patient metadata -> tokenizer -> embedding 
                                model -> text embedding. Stage 3: concatened image embedding + text embedding -> classification model -> fracture 
                                risk index.

                                TutorHub is a webapp wherein students looking for tutors can post advertisements and tutors looking 
                                for jobs can apply for them. The students can also directly ask a teacher to tutor them via sending 
                                requests to their profile. The novelty of this webapp is that it filters those requests and 
                                advertisements based on location, pay(for tutors) and budget(for students). It also uses a rating 
                                system so users can filter good tutors from the rest or unruly or trouble students from the rest. 
                                Additionally, it offers various tools like grouped SMS sending, grade uploading, calendars etc. which 
                                tutors might need to keep track of their students. Links:
